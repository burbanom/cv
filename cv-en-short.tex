\cvevent{Data Engineer}{Devoteam/Ysance}{2021 -- Ongoing}{Île de France, France}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{L'Oréal} As part of one of the IT/BI teams within the R\&D deparment, I participated in a project whose aim was to migrate the existing data pipelines from a Talend/Hadoop environement towards an Airflow/GCP solution.
\end{itemize}

\cvevent{Data Engineer/Scientist and instructor}{Lincoln/Alten}{2019 -- 2020}{Île de France, France}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Malakoff Humanis} As part of the team in charge of the data infrastructure, I developed a series of scipts aimed at analyzing the data required for the successful migration of the company's machine learning projects developed on Dataiku DSS. These models relied on data hosted on-premise which was to be moved to the AWS cloud. 
\item \textbf{Orange} I integrated the General Public Marketing team in order to migrate the existing SAS datamarts to Dataiku DSS. I also provided several teams with training for this new tool. 
\end{itemize}

\cvevent{Data Engineer/Analyst}{Altran}{2018 -- 2019}{Île de France, France}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Essilor} As a member of the team tasked with implementing and maintaining the software used internally for optical calculations, I participated in the push towards the creation of a data infrastructure on the cloud AWS. The aim was to be able to exploit the data by making it available to the data science and R\&D teams. I also contributed to the team by automating the analysis of regression tests by developing a series of pyhon scripts which accelerated the team's ability to respond to software bugs.
\end{itemize}

\divider

\cvevent{Research Engineer}{CEA}{2016 -- 2018}{Saclay, France}
\begin{itemize}
\item I carried out refactoring and modularisation of an electrochemistry modelling program used to perform Molecular Dynamics simulations of \textit{supercapacitors} at constant potential.
\item I implemented a new method for solving electrostatic equations, which was then made available as a stand-alone Fortran library.  
\end{itemize}

\cvsection[sidebar-en-1]{Professional experience -- cont.}

\cvevent{Postdoctoral researcher}{UPMC}{2014 -- 2016}{Paris, France}
\begin{itemize}
\item Using Python, I fitted models to study correlated motion in
battery components.
\item I established procedures to generate/analyse large
quantities of data used to explain materials'
properties using Fortran/Python. 
\end{itemize}

\divider

\cvevent{Ph.D. in Computational Chemistry}{Trinity College Dublin}{2009 -- 2013}{Dublin, Ireland}
Computer modelling of metal oxides
\smallskip
\begin{itemize}
\item I performed molecular simulations of materials for energy production and storage
\item Using theoretical predictions, I helped dispell
misconceptions regarding the roles of impurities
and morphology as possible enhancers of
desired qualities in materials used to generate
energy.
\item I used Fortran/MPI to write simulation and data analysis programs
\end{itemize}

%% main column.
